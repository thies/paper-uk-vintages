abstract = {The mechanism by which changes in the supply of developable land affect housing prices and housing output is analyzed. The objective is to determine whether a sudden scarcity of land raises housing prices because of suppressed current housing production or because of higher investment demand. The analysis is based on Hong Kong, a city-state where the supply of new land is under strict government control, providing a unique situation for studying the impact of supply restrictions. A multiequation aggregate housing model is developed in which government land sales are incorporated in both housing demand and supply. The results show that supply restrictions in Hong Kong have caused higher housing prices but not lower housing output. The higher prices result directly from capitalization of expected higher rents, and they encourage capital land substitution in housing production.},

abstract = {We estimate how households trade off immediate costs and uncertain future benefits that occur in the very long run, 100 or more years away. We exploit a unique feature of housing markets in the United Kingdom and Singapore, where residential property ownership takes the form of either leaseholds or freeholds. Leaseholds are temporary, prepaid, and tradable ownership contracts with maturities between 99 and 999 years, while freeholds are perpetual ownership contracts. The price difference between leaseholds and freeholds reflects the present value of perpetual rental income starting at leasehold expiration, and is thus informative about very long-run discount rates. We estimate the price discounts for varying leasehold maturities compared to freeholds and extremely long-run leaseholds via hedonic regressions using proprietary data sets of the universe of transactions in each country. Households discount very long-run cash flows at low rates, assigning high present value to cash flows hundreds of years in the future. For example, 100-year leaseholds are valued at more than 10% less than otherwise identical freeholds, implying discount rates below 2.6% for 100-year claims.},

abstract = {There are large discrepancies among estimates of the cropland area in China due to the lack of reliable data. In this study, we used Landsat TM/ETM data at a spatial resolution of 30 m to reconstruct spatial and temporal patterns of cropland across China for the time period of 1990-2000. Our estimate has indicated that total cropland area in China in 2000 was 141.1 million hectares (ha), including 35.6 million ha paddy land and 105.5 million ha dry farming land. The distribution of cropland is uneven across the regions of China. The North-East region of China shows more cropland area per capita than the South-East and North regions of China. During 1990-2000, cropland increased by 2.79 million ha, including 0.25 million ha of paddy land and 2.53 million ha of dry farming land. The North-East and North-West regions of China gained cropland area, while the North and South-East regions showed a loss of cropland area. Urbanization accounted for more than half of the transformation from cropland to other land uses, and the increase in cropland was primarily due to reclamation of grassland and deforestation. Most of the lost cropland had good quality with high productivity, but most gained cropland was poor quality land with less suitability for crop production. The globalization as well as changing environment in China is affecting land-use change. Coordinating the conflict between environmental conservation and land demands for food will continue to be a primary challenge for China in the future. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {People are alarmingly susceptible to manipulations that change both their expectations and experience of the value of goods. Recent studies in behavioral economics suggest such variability reflects more than mere caprice. People commonly judge options and prices in relative terms, rather than absolutely, and display strong sensitivity to exemplar and price anchors. We propose that these findings elucidate important principles about reward processing in the brain. In particular, relative valuation may be a natural consequence of adaptive coding of neuronal firing to optimise sensitivity across large ranges of value. Furthermore, the initial apparent arbitrariness of value may reflect the brains' attempts to optimally integrate diverse sources of value-relevant information in the face of perceived uncertainty. Recent findings in neuroscience support both accounts, and implicate regions in the orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the construction of value.},

REITs offer a unique setting in which to study these events because they do not pay taxes at the firm level. Theory suggests that the net tax gain to corporate borrowing is unambiguously negative for a REIT. Contrary to some recent studies, however, we find a positive stock price reaction to debt offerings, while the negative equity-issuance effect is preserved. Further empirical evidence lends support to signalling as the explanation for the positive significant debtissuance effect},

@article{Yechiam2013,
abstract = {It has been shown that in certain situations losses exert a stronger effect on behavior than respective gains, and this has been commonly explained by the argument that losses are given more weight in people's decisions than respective gains. However, although much is understood about the effect of losses on cognitive processes and behavior, 2 major inconsistencies remain. First, recent empirical evidence fails to demonstrate that people avoid incentive structures that carry equivalent gains and losses. Second, findings in experience-based decision tasks indicate that following losses, increased arousal is observed simultaneously with no behavioral loss aversion. To account for these findings, we developed an attention-allocation model as a comprehensive framework for the effect of losses. According to this model losses increase on-task attention, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to the reinforcement structure. In the current article we examine whether this model can account for a broad range of empirical phenomena involving losses. We show that as predicted by the attentional model, asymmetric effects of losses on behavior emerge where gains and losses are presented separately but not concurrently. Yet, even in the absence of loss aversion, losses have distinct effects on performance, arousal, frontal cortical activation, and behavioral consistency. The attentional model of losses thus explains some of the main inconsistencies in previous studies of the effect of losses.},

We show that a distressed firm, on average, sells its real estate asset, most frequently used collateral type, at a discount of 22% relative to a healthy firm. We then identify asset deployability and the availability of potential buyers as two important determinants of the average price in a distress sale. Our loan level analysis indicates that bank loan spreads incorporate information on real estate assets' alternative uses and the availability of their potential buyers. We use surges of foreign investor demand from countries with increased policy uncertainty as plausibly exogenous shocks to commercial real estate prices. Our results show that the firms with real estate portfolios that experience this price appreciation enjoy lower bank rates that we attribute to increased collateral values.},

@article{Lakshminaryanan2008,
abstract = {In humans, the capacity for economically rational choice is constrained by a variety of preference biases: humans evaluate gambles relative to arbitrary reference points; weigh losses heavier than equally sized gains; and demand a higher price for owned goods than for equally preferred goods that are not yet owned. To date, however, fewer studies have examined the origins of these biases. Here, we review previous work demonstrating that human economic biases such as loss aversion and reference dependence are shared with an ancestrally related New World primate, the capuchin monkey (Cebus apella). We then examine whether capuchins display an endowment effect in a token-trading task. We identified pairs of treats (fruit discs versus cereal chunks) that were equally preferred by each monkey. When given a chance to trade away their owned fruit discs to obtain the equally valued cereal chunks (or vice versa), however, monkeys required a far greater compensation than the equally preferred treat. We show that these effects are not due to transaction costs or timing issues. These data suggest that biased preferences rely on cognitive systems that are more evolutionarily ancient than previously thought-and that common evolutionary ancestry shared by humans and capuchins may account for the occurrence of the endowment effect in both species.},

@article{Liu2017,
abstract = {Given the present size of modern cities, it is beyond the perceptual capacity of most people to develop a good knowledge about the qualities of the urban space at every street corner. Correspondingly, for planners, it is also difficult to accurately answer questions such as ‘where the quality of the physical environment is the most dilapidated in the city that regeneration should be given first consideration' and ‘in fast urbanising cities, how is the city appearance changing'. To address this issue, in the present study, we present a computer vision method that contains three machine learning models for the large-scale and automatic evaluation on the qualities of the urban environment by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and wide-coverage street view images. From various physical qualities that have been identified by previous research to be important for the urban visual experience, we choose two key qualities, the construction and maintenance quality of building facade and the continuity of street wall, to be measured in this research. To test the validity of the proposed method, we compare the machine scores with public rating scores collected on-site from 752 passers-by at 56 locations in the city. We show that the machine learning models can produce a medium-to-good estimation of people's real experience, and the modelling results can be applied in many ways by researchers, planners and local residents.},

abstract = {Most housing models, and most policy analysis, hinge on explicit or implicit estimates of the price elasticity of supply of housing: does the market respond to demand side shocks with more supply or higher prices? Building on a model originally developed by Steve Mayo, we estimate the price elasticity of supply of housing from new construction separately for the United States and for the United Kingdom. We examine the supply elasticity over a very long time frame—from the previous century. There is strong evidence of a “regime shift” in 1914–1947; over the entire period, prices rise in both countries, but not in a continuous manner. Post World War II, the United States is essentially flat, albeit with very large cycles. In the UK, relative housing prices generally rise postwar. According to our flow model, in the prewar United States our implied price elasticity is between 4 and 10, postwar it is between 6 and 13. In the prewar UK our implied price elasticity is between 1 and 4, postwar it is between 0 and 1. Stock adjustment models yield different price elasticities—surprisingly so, in our judgment. They range from 1 to 6 for the United States, and from 0 to 1 for the UK. We believe the stock adjustment models are particularly fruitful areas for additional work.},

The competitive neture of a local commercial real estate market relies on a Herlindahl ratio derived from individual developers' shares of total office construction in their market. All else being equal, greater competition among local developers is associated with more building starts. Other variable suggested by the real options pricing model, including the volatility of local lease rates, are also found to be statistically important. In addition, we provide evidence consistent with greater competition sttenuating the extent to which increases in volatility delay commercial real estate development. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

@article{Goetzmann1993,
abstract = {In this paper, transaction prices of paintings brought to market at least twice over the period 1715-1986 are used to construct an art return index. The index allows a comparison of painting price movements to stock-market fluctuations, and also an evaluation of the risk and return characteristics of art investment. I find evidence of a strong relationship between the demand for art and aggregate financial wealth over the very long term, manifested by the fact that the art index and an index of London Stock exchange shares over the same period are highlly correlated. I interpret this as evidence that the demand for art increases with the wealth of art collectors. The relationship between art prices and wealth has further implications for art as an investment vehicle. While an art buyer might expect that holding a "collectible" asset provides a hedge against the fluctuations of the stock market, the opposite appears to be the case. Consequently, the risk and return characteristics of a painting portfolio suggest that a risk-averse agent would typically not find art to be an attractive purchase for investment purposes alone. While returns to art investment have exceeded inflation for long periods, and returns in the second half of the 20th century have rivaled the stock market, they are no higher than would be justified by the extraordinary risks they represent. My results tend to support the analysis of others who have found a positive relationship between art and the stock market over shorter periods of time (see John Picard Stein, 1973, 1977; Michael F. Bryan, 1985; Olivier Chantel et al., 1990a, b; Leslie Singer, 1990) and to confirm the finding by William Baumol (1986) that art may be dominated as an investment vehicle. It differs from previous research (e.g. Singer, 1978, 1990; Bruno Frey and Werner W. Pommerehne, 1989a, b) in that it focuses on the time-series behavior of art and the stock and bond markets over very long periods. (first 2 paragraphs, p. 1370)},

abstract = {What is the impact of real estate prices on corporate investment? In the presence of financing frictions, firms use pledgeable assets as collateral to finance new projects. Hence, shocks to the value of real estate can have a large impact on aggregate investment. Over the 1993-2007 period, the representative U.S. corporation invests 6 cents out of each additional dollar of collateral. To compute this sensitivity, we use local real estate shocks as shocks to the collateral value of firms that own real estate. We address the endogeneity of local real estate prices using the interaction of interest rates and local constraints on land supply as an instrument. We address the endogeneity of the decision to own land (1) by controlling for observable determinants of ownership and (2) by looking at the investment of firms before and after they acquire land. The sensitivity of investment to collateral value is stronger the more likely a firm is to be credit constrained. We interpret these results in the light of a dynamic model of investment under financing constraints. * We are grateful to Institut Europlace de Finance for financial support. For their helpful comments, we would like to thank},

In addition, the paper characterizes the features that make some property types more prone to such boom-and-bust behavior. The combination of demand uncertainty, adjustment costs, and construction lags leads to two phenomena that may help explain market persistence. The first phenomenon is the reluctance of owners to adjust occupancy levels, even in the face of large shifts in renter demand. The second phenomenon is the occurrence of periods of sustained overbuilding: the addition of new supply in the face of already high vacancy rates. Copyright 1995 by Kluwer Academic Publishers},

abstract = {Recent developments in techniques for modeling, digitizing and visualizing\n3D shapes has led to an explosion in the number of available 3D models\non the Internet and in domain-specific databases. This has led to\nthe development of 3D shape retrieval systems that, given a query\nobject, retrieve similar 3D objects. For visualization, 3D shapes\nare often represented as a surface, in particular polygonal meshes,\nfor example in VRML format. Often these models contain holes, intersecting\npolygons, are not manifold, and do not enclose a volume unambiguously.\nOn the contrary, 3D volume models, such as solid models produced\nby CAD systems, or voxels models, enclose a volume properly. This\npaper surveys the literature on methods for content based 3D retrieval,\ntaking into account the applicability to surface models as well as\nto volume models. The methods are evaluated with respect to several\nrequirements of content based 3D shape retrieval, such as: (1) shape\nrepresentation requirements, (2) properties of dissimilarity measures,\n(3) efficiency, (4) discrimination abilities, (5) ability to perform\npartial matching, (6) robustness, and (7) necessity of pose normalization.\nFinally, the advantages and limitations of the several approaches\nin content based 3D shape retrieval are discussed. &copy; 2007 Springer\nScience+Business Media, LLC.},

Based on a detailed cross-sectional survey of English households, it finds that housing demand is significantly determined by a household's human capital, and that housing demand generally increases with age. After retirement it declines, but only to a small extent. High education levels, good health, and high income will increase a household's demand for housing even when households age. These results are relevant for countries that experience population shrinkage, but where total housing demand could still grow in the future despite stagnating household numbers and aging populations. The paper further shows that changes in demographics lead to very heterogeneous demand responses for different housing attributes, providing information regarding the future qualitative demand for housing. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Therefore, in- dices of changes in market value that are based on asset transaction prices will systematically reflect intertemporal differences in the ease of selling a property. We define and develop a concept of “constant-liquidity value” in the context of a model that is characterized by pro-cyclical volume of trading. We then present an econometric model that allows for estimation of both a standard transaction-based price index and a constant-liquidity index. Our application to the NCREIF database reveals that, in the case of institutional commercial real estate investment, constant-liquidity values tend to lead transaction-based and appraisal-based indices in time, and also to display greater volatility and cycle amplitude. The differences can be significant for strategic investment policy viewed from a mean-variance portfolio optimization perspective.w},

Traders provide market liquidity, and their ability to do so depends on their availability of funding. Conversely, traders' funding, i.e., their capital and margin requirements, depends on the assets' market liquidity. We show that, under certain conditions, margins are destabilizing and market liquidity and funding liquidity are mutually reinforcing, leading to liquidity spirals. The model explains the empirically documented features that market liquidity (i) can suddenly dry up, (ii) has commonality across securities, (iii) is related to volatility, (iv) is subject to “flight to quality,” and (v) co-moves with the market. The model provides new testable predictions, including that speculators' capital is a driver of market liquidity and risk premiums.},

abstract = {The shape of buildings plays a critical role in the energy efficiency, lifestyles, land use and infrastructure systems of cities. Thus, as most of the world's cities continue to grow and develop, understanding the interplay between the characteristics of urban environments and the built form of cities is essential to achieve local and global sustainability goals. Here, we compile and analyze the most extensive data set of building shapes to date, covering more than 4.8 million individual buildings across several major cities in North America. We show that average building height increases systematically with city size and follows theoretical predictions derived from urban scaling theory. We also study the allometric relationship between surface area and volume of buildings in terms of characteristic shape parameters. This allows us to demonstrate that the reported trend towards higher (and more voluminous) buildings effectively decreases the average surface-to-volume ratio, suggesting potentially significant energy savings with growing city size. At the same time, however, the surface-to-volume ratio increases in the downtown cores of large cities, due to shape effects and specifically to the proliferation of tall, needlelike buildings. Thus, the issue of changes in building shapes with city size and associated energy management problem is highly heterogeneous. It requires a systematic approach that includes the factors that drive the form of built environments, entangling physical, infrastructural and socioeconomic aspects of cities.},

abstract = {Policy makers, urban planners, architects, sociologists, and economists are interested in creating urban areas that are both lively and safe. But are the safety and liveliness of neighborhoods independent characteristics? Or are they just two sides of the same coin? In a world where people avoid unsafe looking places, neighborhoods that look unsafe will be less lively, and will fail to harness the natural surveillance of human activity. But in a world where the preference for safe looking neighborhoods is small, the connection between the perception of safety and liveliness will be either weak or nonexistent. In this paper we explore the connection between the levels of activity and the perception of safety of neighborhoods in two major Italian cities by combining mobile phone data (as a proxy for activity or liveliness) with scores of perceived safety estimated using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a dataset of Google Street View images scored using a crowdsourced visual perception survey. We find that: (i) safer looking neighborhoods are more active than what is expected from their population density, employee density, and distance to the city centre; and (ii) that the correlation between appearance of safety and activity is positive, strong, and significant, for females and people over 50, but negative for people under 30, suggesting that the behavioral impact of perception depends on the demographic of the population. Finally, we use occlusion techniques to identify the urban features that contribute to the appearance of safety, finding that greenery and street facing windows contribute to a positive appearance of safety (in agreement with Oscar Newman's defensible space theory). These results suggest that urban appearance modulates levels of human activity and, consequently, a neighborhood's rate of natural surveillance.},

abstract = {Rising concern for the societal implications of artificial intelligence systems has inspired a wave of academic and journalistic literature in which deployed systems are audited for harm by investigators from outside the organizations deploying the algorithms. However, it remains challenging for practitioners to identify the harmful repercussions of their own systems prior to deployment, and, once deployed, emergent issues can become difficult or impossible to trace back to their source. In this paper, we introduce a framework for algorithmic auditing that supports artificial intelligence system development end-to-end, to be applied throughout the internal organization development lifecycle. Each stage of the audit yields a set of documents that together form an overall audit report, drawing on an organization's values or principles to assess the fit of decisions made throughout the process. The proposed auditing framework is intended to contribute to closing the accountability gap in the development and deployment of large-scale artificial intelligence systems by embedding a robust process to ensure audit integrity.},

abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between land use regulation and residential construction. We characterize regulations as either adding explicit costs, uncertainty, or delays to the development process. The theoretical framework suggests that the effects on new construction vary by the type of regulation. Using quarterly data from a panel of 44 U.S. metropolitan areas between 1985 and 1996, we find that land use regulation lowers the level of the steady-state of new construction. Our estimates suggest that metropolitan areas with more extensive regulation can have up to 45 percent fewer starts and price elasticities that are more than 20 percent lower than those in less-regulated markets. One implication of regulations that lengthen the development process is that the short- and long-run effects of demand shocks will vary relative to conditions in markets without such delays. We find support for this observation in the data. As well, we find other differences by type of regulation: Development or impact fees have relatively little impact on new construction, but regulations that lengthen the development process or otherwise constrain new development have larger and more significant effects.

It provides for the first time robust estimates of the diversification gains attainable given return, risk and cross-correlations across individual properties actually available to fund managers.

C., we estimate the price of vacant land based on properties that were sold and redeveloped. The price of developed land is also estimated based on properties that were sold and not redeveloped. Various tests overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that housing is redeveloped when the price of vacant land exceeds the price of land in its current use.

abstract = {Geographic information systems (GIS) provide powerful tools for storing and manipulating large amounts of information on spatial relationships. However, applications of GIS in urban economics and real estate are infrequent. As a symptom of this, there is often little relation between the extensive literature on residential mortgages and the housing markets literature. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the potential contributions GIS could make to urban economic and real estate economic research and open debate on GIS as applied to these fields. Beginning with theory, we determine how GIS can be useful to researchers and what is needed from future GIS. A GIS is a database management system with a spatial reference. It is capable of providing researchers with excellent control over spatial relationships. For example, one can “geocode” the housing transactions used for hedonic pricing studies. The process of geocoding assigns a latitude and longitude coordinate for each transaction. This enables much more elaborate spatial analysis than with traditional techniques such as using a ruler on a paper map. For instance, GIS allows the hedonic pricing literature to be reworked using spatial autoregressive analysis (SAR). SAR models need to repeatedly calculate large numbers of distances from each observation to every other observation within a given radius. In this context, GIS software is primarily useful for assigning a latitude and longitude location to each observation based on the best of street, ZIP, or ZIP+4. These geocoded observations may then be exported to other software for batch processing of SAR statistics. Future development of GIS software should eliminate the need for multiple software packages. Likewise, road distances with flexible weights (e.g., depending on type of road or on construction delays) awaits further software development.},

@article{Fisher2007,
abstract = {This article presents a methodology for producing a quarterly transactions-based index (TBI) of property-level investment performance for U.S. institutional real estate. Indices are presented for investment periodic total returns and capital appreciation (or price-changes) for the major property types included in the NCREIF Property Index. These indices are based on transaction prices to avoid appraisal-based sources of index “smoothing” and lagging bias. In addition to producing variable-liquidity indices, this approach employs the Fisher-Gatzlaff-Geltner-Haurin ( Real Estate Econ., 31: 269–303, 2003) methodology to produce separate indices tracking movements on the demand and supply sides of the investment market, including a “constant-liquidity” (demand side) index. Extensions of Bayesian noise filtering techniques developed by Gatzlaff and Geltner ( Real Estate Finance, 15: 7–22, 1998) and Geltner and Goetzmann ( J. Real Estate Finance Econ., 21: 5–21, 2000) are employed to allow development of quarterly frequency, market segment specific indices. The hedonic price model used in the indices is based on an extension of the Clapp and Giacotto ( J. Am. Stat. Assoc., 87: 300–306, 1992) “assessed value method,” using a NCREIF-reported recent appraised value of each transacting property as the composite “hedonic” variable, thus allowing time-dummy coefficients to represent the difference each period between the (lagged) appraisals and the transaction prices. The index could also be used to produce a mass appraisal of the NCREIF property database each quarter, a byproduct of which would be the ability to provide transactions price based “automated valuation model” estimates of property value for each NCREIF property each quarter.},

abstract = {China's land use has undergone many changes over the past 300. years due to the significant transformations caused by natural and human factors and their impact on regional climate and the environment. This comprehensive review of recent state-of-the-art studies of China's land-use changes during that period concentrates on cropland, forest, grassland and urban areas. While most small-scale studies have reconstructed information from historical archive data and focused on a specific time period, large-scale studies have tended to rely on inverse modeling techniques to interpret land-use change dynamics based on remote-sensing data for example, the global land-use products of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) and Center for Sustainability and the Global Environment (SAGE) datasets. All studies have shown that the cropland areas in China increased between 1700 and 1950, although they indicate different magnitudes and rates. A decrease in forest coverage was also reported in all studies. Little information was available on urban and grassland areas over the same period. Rapid urbanization in China has been particularly evident in the past 50. years. Meanwhile, spatially explicit reconstructions of historical land-use change in China since 1700 remain highly uncertain due to the lack of reliable data. Extensive work on primary data collection is required, including land-use records and drivers for future change. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {This paper uncovers a new phenomenon in web search that we call domain bias — a user's propensity to believe that a page is more relevant just because it comes from a par- ticular domain. We provide evidence of the existence of domain bias in click activity as well as in human judgments via a comprehensive collection of experiments. We begin by studying the difference between domains that a search engine surfaces and that users click. Surprisingly, we find that despite changes in the overall distribution of surfaced domains, there has not been a comparable shift in the dis- tribution of clicked domains. Users seem to have learned the landscape of the internet and their click behavior has thus become more predictable over time. Next, we run a blind domain test, akin to a Pepsi/Coke taste test, to determine whether domains can shift a user's opinion of which page is more relevant. We find that domains can actually flip a user's preference about 25% of the time. Finally, we demon- strate the existence of systematic domain preferences, even after factoring out confounding issues such as position bias and relevance, two factors that have been used extensively in past work to explain user behavior. The existence of domain bias has numerous consequences including, for example, the importance of discounting click activity from reputable do- mains.},

abstract = {This paper provides evidence that stock traders focus on round numbers as cognitive reference points for value. Using a random sample of more than 100 million stock transactions, we find excess buying (selling) by liquidity demanders at all price points one penny below (above) round numbers. Further, the size of the buy-sell imbalance is monotonic in the roundness of the adjacent round number (i.e., largest adjacent to integers, second-largest adjacent to half-dollars, etc.). Conditioning on the price path, we find much stronger excess buying (selling) by liquidity demanders when the ask falls (bid rises) to reach the integer than when it crosses the integer. We discuss and test three explanations for these results. Finally, 24-hour returns also vary by price point, and buy-sell imbalances are a major determinant of that variation across price points. Buying (selling) by liquidity demanders below (above) round numbers yield losses approaching $1 billion per year.},

Real estate list and transaction prices exhibit two price-ending characteristics, even (000-ending) and just-below-even (900-ending). The use of even-ending prices is negatively related to the precision of the price estimates and the cost of rounding. However, the tendency to use just-below-even-ending prices is related to the cost of rounding and to listing agency characteristics. The transaction price and the number of days on market are associated with list price clustering and with listing agency characteristics. Most properties are listed at just-below-even-ending prices, but those listed at even-ending prices sell faster and at a higher price. Finally, better transaction outcomes are positively associated with the number of area-properties listed by the seller's real-estate agency.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the spectacular rise and fall of structured finance. The essence of structured finance activities is the pooling of economic assets like loans, bonds, and mortgages, and the subsequent issuance of a prioritized capital structure of claims, known as tranches, against these collateral pools. As a result of the prioritization scheme used in structuring claims, many of the manufactured tranches are far safer than the average asset in the underlying pool. This ability of structured finance to repackage risks and to create "safe" assets from otherwise risky collateral led to a dramatic expansion in the issuance of structured securities, most of which were viewed by investors to be virtually risk-free and certified as such by the rating agencies. At the core of the recent financial market crisis has been the discovery that these securities are actually far riskier than originally advertised. We examine how the process of securitization allowed trillions of dollars of risky assets to be transformed into securities that were widely considered to be safe. We highlight two features of structured finance products - the extreme fragility of their ratings to modest imprecision in evaluating underlying risks, and their exposure to systematic risks - that go a long way in explaining the spectacular rise and fall of structured finance. We conclude with an assessment of what went wrong and the relative importance of rating agency errors, investor credulity, and perverse incentives and suspect behavior on the part of issuers, rating agencies, and borrowers.},

We test the empirical validity of the partial adjustment model that underlies the traditional "unsmoothing" of benchmark return indexes. We reject the no-lag null hypothesis and find that the extent of bias-inducing behavior appears to vary over time in the manner suggested by rational appraisal behavior as the quantity and quality of contemporaneous transaction information changes. We find evidence that appraisers valuing the same property in consecutive periods anchor onto their previous appraised values, resulting in more lagging than first-time appraisals. An implied policy prescription is for investment managers to rotate appraisers so as not to allow the same appraisal firm to consecutively value the same property.},

abstract = {Does information asymmetry and the subsequent agency problems in mortgage intermediation affect house-hold level outcomes? This paper examines whether the dispersion of collateral ownership through the creation of multiple mortgage-backed security (MBS) tranches impacted the probability that a delinquent mortgage would be renegotiated. A conceptual framework describes how the multiplicity of tranches worsens the agency problem between a mortgage servicer and the MBS deal sponsor, leading to a sub-optimal rate of loan modification. Using within-deal variation in the number and structure of tranches, I find that loans in pools collateralizing fewer tranches are more likely to be renegotiated, conditional upon being seriously delinquent. The results provide evidence for one channel through which the securitization of mortgages inhibited the renegotiation of delinquent mortgages in the wake of the housing crisis.},

abstract = {There exist real analytical difficulties in modelling the supply of housing due to its heterogeneity, durability, as well as the conversion of existing housing stock. The estimation methods used in the studies of the determinants of housing supply may be categorised into the following approaches: reduced form estimation, structural approaches, and error correction models. The various approaches to estimate supply elasticity give rise to a wide range of elasticity estimates. Estimates for the same city and for the same period can vary depending on the estimation method and data used. Empirical estimates of US housing supply elasticity also indicate significant geographical variations. Outside of the United States, the empirical literature on housing supply is small but growing rapidly. Studies show the United Kingdom to have less elastic supply as compared to the United States. Malaysia and Korea have inelastic supply curves for housing, while Thailand and the United States have elastic supply. Housing supply elasticity is dependent on a number of factors: the availability of land for new housing construction, planning systems, structure construction costs, government land regulations, and the degree of government intervention in housing markets on the supply side. Since the housing supply elasticity determines the level of house price and its variability when faced with a demand shock, the large impacts of speculation in real estate and housing bubbles are more likely where supply is inelastic. Housing supply elasticity also has implications for regional productivity and employment growth, as well as the distribution of income across and within cities. ?? 2012 Copyright ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..},

@article{Quigley2004,
abstract = {P ublic concern over the affordability of housing arises from two factors. First, housing is the single largest expenditure item in the budgets of most families and individuals. The average household devotes roughly one-quarter of income to housing expenditures, while poor and near-poor households commonly devote half of their incomes to housing. These high proportions suggest that small percentage changes in housing prices and rents will have large impacts on nonhousing consumption and household well-being. Second, many large U.S. metropolitan areas have experienced recent and well-publicized increases in housing prices and rents. For example, between 1995 and 2002, the median home price increased by 65 percent (in nominal terms) in the San Francisco Bay Area, 62 percent in Boston, 54 percent in San Diego and 49 percent in Denver. The comparable changes in rents for a standard two-bedroom apartment are 76 percent for San Francisco, 61 percent for Boston, 49 percent for San Diego and 62 percent for Denver. While these metropolitan areas represent the extremes, median home prices and rents increased consider-ably in nearly all of the largest metropolitan areas. Housing affordability is regularly raised as a major policy concern, most recently by the bipartisan Millennial Housing Commission (2002). But economists are wary, even uncomfortable, with the rhetoric of " affordability, " which jumbles together in a single term a number of disparate issues: the distribution of housing prices, the distribution of housing quality, the distribution of income, the ability of households to borrow, public policies affecting housing markets, conditions affect-ing the supply of new or refurbished housing, and the choices that people make about how much housing to consume relative to other goods. This mixture of issues raises difficulties in interpreting even basic facts about housing affordability. For example, the rapid rise in the price of homes clearly made homeownership more difficult for many renters, but it also greatly reduced the financial costs of home-ownership to a much larger group of existing homeowners by providing substantial capital gains. Among renters, the large share of income devoted to housing surely reflects voluntary consumption choices for many households and the consumption of a publicly determined minimum quality and quantity of housing for others. To the extent that the latter group of households would choose a lower quality of housing, given their opportunities, one might conclude that the incomes of the poorest households are insufficient to afford the socially imposed minimum standard. This paper sorts out these issues. We show that for the two-thirds of U.S. households who own homes, there is little evidence that housing has become less affordable in recent years. For the one-third of U.S. households who are renters, the proportion of income that the median renter devotes to housing has increased only modestly. However, we find pronounced increases in the typical rental bur-dens for poor and near-poor households. Thus, we examine the low-income rental market in greater detail, evaluating the contribution of changes in the income distribution, increases in rental quality, land-use regulation, growth controls and zoning to the observed changes in rent burdens among low-income households. We end by sketching some policies that might improve the affordability of housing for homeowners and for renters.},

The psychophysics of value induce risk aversion in the domain of gains and risk seeking in the domain of losses.

Decision problems can be described or framed in multiple ways that give rise to different preferences, contrary to the invariance criterion of rational choice. The process of mental accounting, in which people organize the outcomes of transactions, explains some anomalies of consumer behavior. In particular, the acceptability of an option can depend on whether a negative outcome is evaluated as a cost or as an uncompensated loss. The relationships between decision values and experience values and between hedonic experience and objective states are discussed.},

Certain stores generate externalities by drawing customers to other stores, whereas many stores primarily benefit from external mall traffic. Therefore, to varying degrees, the success of each store depends upon the presence and effort of other stores, and the effort of the developer to attract customers to the mall. Using a unique data set of mall tenant contracts, we show that rental contracts are written to (i) efficiently price the net externality of each store and (ii) align the incentives to induce optimal effort by the developer and each mall store according to the externality of each store's effort.},

Using a panel dataset consisting of 35 cities in China from 1998 to 2009, we find the implied national price elasticity of housing supply to be between 2.8 and 5.6. Our city-level analysis reveals that geographic, economic as well as regulatory factors are significant determinants of the variation in the observed price elasticity of housing supply. The study of a different regulatory and economic environment contributes to the growing literature on supply elasticity and helps explain the seemingly wide variation in supply elasticities observed across cities and countries.},

abstract = {As in the standard land assembly problem, a developer wants to buy two adjacent blocks of land belonging to two different owners. The value of the two blocks of land to the developer is greater than the sum of the individual values of the blocks for each owner. Unlike the land assembly literature, however, our focus is on the incentive that each lot owner has to delay the start of negotiations, rather than on the public goods nature of the problem. An incentive for delay exists, for example, when owners perceive that being last to sell will allow them to capture a larger share of the joint surplus from the development. We show that competition at point of sale can cause equilibrium delay, and that cooperation at point of sale will eliminate delay. This suggests that strategic delay is another source for the inefficient allocation of land, in addition to the public-good type externality pointed out by Grossman and Hart [Bell Journal of Economics 11 (1980) 42] and O'Flaherty [Regional Science and Urban Economics 24 (1994) 287]. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6% error on the test set) and 17.3% top-1 error on the validation set.},

abstract = {This study explores the combined application of remote sensing, spatial metrics and spatial modeling to the analysis and modeling of urban growth in Santa Barbara, California. The investigation is based on a 72-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical aerial photography and from IKONOS satellite imagery. Spatial metrics were used both specifically to assess the impact of urban development in four administrative districts, and generally to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban growth. The metrics quantify the temporal and spatial properties of urban development, and show definitively the impacts of growth constraints imposed on expansion by topography and by local planning efforts. The SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model was calibrated using the multi-temporal data sets for the entire study region. The calibrated model allowed us to fill gaps in the discontinuous historical time series of urban spatial extent, since maps and images were available only for selected years between 1930 and 2001. The model also allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth to the year 2030. The spatial metrics provided a detailed description of the accuracy of the model's historical simulations that applied also to forecasts of future development. The results illustrate the utility of modeling in explaining the amount and spatial pattern of urban growth. Even using modeling, however, the forecasting of urban development remains problematic and could benefit from further research on spatial metrics and their incorporation into the model calibration process. The combined approach using remote sensing, spatial metrics and urban modeling is powerful, and may prove a productive new direction for the improved understanding, representation and modeling of the spatiotemporal forms due to the process of urbanization. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Land-use classification based on spaceborne or aerial remote sensing images has been extensively studied over the past decades. Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify fa{\c{c}}ade structures from street view images, such as Google StreetView, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada and the US.},

Yet, this research is limited by the lack of methods that can be used to quantify the appearance of streetscapes across cities or at high enough spatial resolutions. In this paper, we describe 'Streetscore', a scene understanding algorithm that predicts the perceived safety of a streetscape, using training data from an online survey with contributions from more than 7000 participants. We first study the predictive power of commonly used image features using support vector regression, finding that Geometric Texton and Color Histograms along with GIST are the best performers when it comes to predict the perceived safety of a streetscape. Using Streetscore, we create high resolution maps of perceived safety for 21 cities in the Northeast and Midwest of the United States at a resolution of 200 images/square mile, scoring $\sim$1 million images from Google Streetview. These datasets should be useful for urban planners, economists and social scientists looking to explain the social and economic consequences of urban perception.},

abstract = {Hong Kong has been faced with property market ups and downs for many reasons over the past 10 years or so. It once experienced shortages of housing supply, leading to prolonged escalating prices. This was followed by a downturn of housing prices since the end of 1997 and in the wake of the financial turmoil in Asia. Hong Kong people have been very concerned with the housing market situation, particularly housing prices, and consider that the problem needs to be addressed to prevent its recurrence in the future. The Hong Kong government uses its land-use planning system to address this "market failure". Also, such a system imposes constraints on land supply and development, through various means by altering the supply of housing land. As a result, the residential property has been affected, and so is the housing price. This paper attempts to explore the impact of the land-use planning system (and land supply) on housing prices in the territory. It starts with the preliminary introduction of the planning system and a review on the previous literature on the impact of land-use planning system on housing prices in Hong Kong. An analytical model is established, followed by the discussion of the empirical findings of the impacts of the land-use regulation on land supply, housing supply and housing prices in the territory. The results in Section 7 show that the planning indicators: (i) the approval rates of planning applications; (ii) the residential floor area under planning applications; and (iii) the area of greenbelt and open space zones, have significant impact on housing prices. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Repeating the analysis with the complete database that includes more than 5,000 companies and a control sample of firms with high corporate real estate ratios, we find a strong and significantly positive relation between our governance index and several performance variables, indicating that the partial lack of a relation between governance and performance in the real estate sector might be explained by a REIT effect.},

abstract = {Using both the lesion method and functional imaging (positron emission tomography) in large cohorts of subjects investigated with the same experimental tasks, we tested the following hypotheses: (A) that the retrieval of words which denote concrete entities belonging to distinct conceptual categories depends upon partially segregated regions in higher-order cortices of the left temporal lobe; and (B) that the retrieval of conceptual knowledge pertaining to the same concrete entities also depends on partially segregated regions; however, those regions will be different from those postulated in hypothesis A, and located predominantly in the right hemisphere (the second hypothesis tested only with the lesion method). The analyses provide support for hypothesis A in that several regions outside the classical Broca and Wernicke language areas are involved in name retrieval of concrete entities, and that there is a partial segregation in the temporal lobe with respect to the conceptual category to which the entities belong, and partial support for hypothesis B in that retrieval of conceptual knowledge is partially segregated from name retrieval in the lesion study. Those regions identified here are seen as parts of flexible, multi-component systems serving concept and word retrieval for concrete entities belonging to different conceptual categories. By comparing different approaches the article also addresses a number of method issues that have surfaced in recent studies in this field.},

abstract = {Despite theoretical developments in recent years, our understanding of corporate capital structure remains incomplete. Prior empirical research has been dominated by archival regression studies which are limited in their ability to fully reflect the diversity found in practice. The present paper reports on a comprehensive survey of corporate financing decision-making in UK listed companies. A key finding is that firms are heterogeneous in their capital structure policies. About half of the firms seek to maintain a target debt level, consistent with trade-off theory, but 60 per cent claim to follow a financing hierarchy, consistent with pecking order theory. These two theories are not viewed by respondents as either mutually exclusive or exhaustive. Many of the theoretical determinants of debt levels are widely accepted by respondents, in particular the importance of interest tax shield, financial distress, agency costs and also, at least implicitly, information asymmetry. Results also indicate that cross-country institutional differences have a significant impact on financial decisions.},

abstract = {During the three-year period ending in July 2003, the rise in housing costs in California far exceeded the national inflation rate. Housing prices in five coastal counties increased by more than 60 percent. For the highest quintile of cities, prices increased by an average of more than thirty percent per year. Evidently California housing markets differ along important dimensions from those in the rest of the country. One striking difference is the degree of regulation governing land use and residential construction. California represents the most extreme example of autarky in land use regulations of any U.S. state. Cities are free to set their rules independently, with little oversight. Moreover, state tax policy creates incentives that are likely to decrease production an increase housing costs. Property taxes are constitutionally limited to one percent of acquisition costs while cities are permitted a share of local sales tax receipts. This creates a regulatory incentive to favor retail development over housing construction, to favor development of expensive housing over moderately priced housing, and to discourage the construction of housing.In this paper, we explore the linkages between land-use regulations, growth in the housing stock, and housing prices in California cities. First, we assess whether housing is more expensive in more regulated cities. Next, we assess whether growth in the housing stock over the period of a decade depends on the degree of land-use regulation at the start of the decade. Finally, we estimate the price elasticity of housing supply in regulated and relatively unregulated cities. Our results suggest that current regulations have powerful effects on housing outcomes.},

These matched series allow us to conduct time series analysis to examine the long-term present value relationship in the housing market. Three key findings are obtained. First, we fail to establish a cointegrating relationship between the home purchase price and rental price based on nationally estimated indexes. Second, area-specific indexes demonstrate strong cross-correlations, invalidating the use of first generation panel unit root tests that ignore these cross-correlations. Third, Pesaran's CIPS test indicates that the unit root hypothesis is rejected for the first difference of both indexes. We also do not reject the hypothesis that area-specific home purchases and rental price indexes are cointegrated with a cointegrating vector (1, −1).},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the stock market and in house values over the course of recent years have led to renewed macroeconomic policy debate as regards the effects of financial and housing wealth in the determination of consumer spending. This research assembles a unique matched sample of household data from the Survey of Consumer Finance and the Consumer Expenditure Survey to estimate the consumption effects of financial and housing wealth. The micro-data permit numerous innovations in the assessment of wealth effects, including an analysis of the impact of wealth on both durable and non-durable consumption and a comparison of wealth effects as derive from gross versus after-debt measures of financial and housing wealth. Further, the research seeks to assess robustness of those estimates to deviations from trend and volatility in financial and housing wealth and among credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Overall, research findings indicate relatively large housing wealth effects. Among homeowners, the housing wealth elasticities are estimated in the range of .06 over the 1989-2001 period. In marked contrast, the estimated elasticities of consumption spending with respect to financial wealth are smaller in magnitude and are in the range of .02. Further, the estimated wealth elasticities appear robust to deviations from trend and volatility in the wealth measures. Research findings support the hypothesized behavioral distinction in household consumption spending across durable versus non-durable categories. Consumption propensities also diverge sharply across the credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Finally, there is little difference in wealth elasticities derived from measures of home equity versus house values. Research findings suggest the possibility of sizable reverse wealth effects. For example, a 10 percent decline in housing wealth from 2005 levels translates into a 1 percentage point decline in real GDP growth, a sizable reduction relative to the approximate 4 percent real GDP growth evidenced in prior years. Results of the analysis point to the sizable economy-wide risks associated with the recent retrenchment in house values. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We show that housing is an important unexplored driver that explains these differences. We exploit the fact that households that overvalue (undervalue) their houses experience an unexpected negative (positive) shock in their housing wealth when they sell their houses. We find that a one standard deviation positive shock in housing wealth increases the probability of an improvement in self-reported health by 1.13 percentage points and decreases the drug-related mortality rate by 0.27. We exploit the geographical variation in unexpected housing wealth shocks and find that households who live in MSAs with more inelastic housing supply experience larger changes in health outcomes.},

This paper rationalizes these cross-market differences in the risk-return relationship for housing, and in so doing, explains the puzzling negative relationship. The paper shows that when the current house provides a hedge against the risk associated with the future housing consumption, households are willing to accept a lower return to compensate for risk, thus weakening the positive risk-return relationship. Further, in markets with less elastic housing supply and a growing population, hedging incentives can be sufficiently strong to make the relationship negative. The empirical analysis confirms these predictions, suggesting that hedging incentives, housing supply, and urban growth are indeed central to understanding the risk-return relationship for housing. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

The findings indicate that investment grade multi-family housing depreciates approximately 2.7% per year in real terms based on total property value. This implies a depreciation rate for just the building of about 3.25% per year. With 2% inflation, this suggests a nominal depreciation rate of about 5.25% per year. Converted into a straight-line depreciation rate that has the same present value, this suggests a depreciable life of 30.5 years - as compared to 27.5 years allowed under the current tax laws. Thus, these laws are slightly favorable to multi-family properties by providing a tax depreciation rate that exceeds economic depreciation, which is in part due to inflation that has been less than expected during the past decade.},

The larger impact is prospectively related to structural limits on investing which favor real estate ownership, along with the dominant position of housing in total household wealth. We also find that a household's consumption varies across housing tenure. Homeowners having joint ownership of property on average have the highest consumption propensity, while those having sole ownership of property consume the most in response to appreciation in housing wealth.

abstract = {The United States spends more than $1B each year on the American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can exceed half a decade. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision techniques improve, automated data analysis may provide a cheaper and faster alternative. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques, we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%). Our results suggest that automated systems for monitoring demographic trends may effectively complement labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to detect trends with fine spatial resolution, in close to real time.},

Yet, the throughput of current methods is too limited to quantify the perception of cities across the world. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new crowdsourced dataset containing 110,988 images from 56 cities, and 1,170,000 pairwise comparisons provided by 81,630 online volunteers along six perceptual attributes: safe, lively, boring, wealthy, depressing, and beautiful. Using this data, we train a Siamese-like convolutional neural architecture, which learns from a joint classification and ranking loss, to predict human judgments of pairwise image comparisons. Our results show that crowdsourcing combined with neural networks can produce urban perception data at the global scale.},

abstract = {Understanding how prior outcomes affect risk attitudes is critical for the study of choice under uncertainty. A large literature documents the influence of prior losses on subsequent risk attitudes. The findings appear contradictory: some studies find that people become more risk seeking after a loss, whereas others assert the opposite -- that they become more risk averse. In this paper, we show that these seemingly inconsistent findings can be explained by individuals' differential responses to realized versus paper losses. Following a realized loss, individuals avoid risk; if the loss has not been realized -- a paper loss -- individuals are more likely to chase their losses and take on even greater risk. We provide support for our framework using existing data and across two experiments. We also show that giving individuals flexibility in choosing when to realize losses can lead to lower earnings in environments where loss-chasing decreases expected returns. Drawing a distinction between paper and realized losses reconciles prior findings, and has important implications for contract design and optimal monitoring.},

Using rent data on a large cross section of residential properties in Amsterdam we are able to develop an annual constant-quality rent index for the entire time period. Whereas nominal rents nearly tripled over the considered sample period, average Amsterdam house rents, in real terms, had approximately the same level in 1850 as they exhibited in 1550. Otherwise stated, nominal rents and goods prices rose at the same pace. Over these 301. years, the real index moves between a minimum level of 45.6 and a maximum of 162.4. As concerns the relation between the housing market and the real economy, we find empirical evidence that fluctuations in rents and fluctuations in proxies of business cycle activity comove, both in nominal and in real terms. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {China had separate rural and urban labor markets for about 40 years until the late 1980's when the restrictions on rural–urban migration were gradually eased. By the end of the 1980's and in the early 1990's, the number of rural migrants working in the urban areas began to increase dramatically. However, rural migrants are treated differently from their urban counterparts in terms of occupational attainment and wages. This paper utilizes two comparable survey data sets to analyze the degree to which the segregation between rural migrants and urban residents has occurred from the point of view of occupational segregation and wage differentials. A significant difference in occupational attainment and wages exists between rural migrants and urban residents. Most of the difference cannot be explained by productivity-related differences between the two groups, implying that urban residents are favorably treated while their migrant counterparts are discriminated against.

I still obtain explicit solutions for the spatial pattern of urban growth, and for the timing of the initial residential development and each successive redevelopment at each distance from the urban center.

abstract = {This paper introduces an integrative approach to hedonic house price modeling which utilizes high density 3D airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. In general, it is shown that extracting exploratory variables using 3D analysis - thus explicitly considering high-rise buildings, shadowing effects, etc. - is crucial in complex urban environments and is limited in well-established raster-based modeling. This is fundamental in large-scale urban analyses where essential determinants influencing real estate prices are constantly missing and are not accessible in official and mass appraiser databases. More specifically, the advantages of this methodology are demonstrated by means of a novel and economically important externality, namely incoming solar radiation, derived separately for each flat. Findings from an empirical case study in Vienna, Austria, applying a non-linear generalized additive hedonic model, suggest that solar radiation is significantly capitalized in flat prices. A model comparison clearly proves that the hedonic model accounting for ALS-based solar radiation performs significantly superior. Compared to a model without this externality, it increases the model's explanatory power by approximately 13% and additionally reduces the prediction error by around 15%. The results provide strong evidence that explanatory variables originating from ALS, explicitly regarding the immediate 3D surroundings, enhance traditional hedonic models in urban environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we explore two issues on the capital structure of REITs: is there a relationship between market-to-book and leverage ratios, and, is the relationship between market-to-book and leverage ratio temporary or persistent. Our results suggest that REITs with historically high marketto- book ratio tend to have persistently high leverage ratio. In essence, REITs with high growth opportunity and high market valuation raise funds through debt issues. This finding, which is robust to various specifications and econometric tests, is contrary to the financing decisions of non-regulated firms. We attribute it to the special regulatory environment of REITs where, despite no apparent benefits to debt financing, management issues debt.},

We test for reference dependence in a large data set of marathon finishing times (n = 9,789,093). Models of reference-dependent preferences such as prospect theory predict bunching of finishing times at reference points. We provide visual and statistical evidence that round numbers (e.g., a four-hour marathon) serve as reference points in this environment and as a result produce significant bunching of performance at these round numbers. Bunching is driven by planning and adjustments in effort provision near the finish line and cannot be explained by explicit rewards (e.g., qualifying for the Boston Marathon), peer effects, or institutional features (e.g., pacesetters).

abstract = {Architectural design has generally not been included in estimations of hedonic pricing models and the reason is no doubt the difficulty in capturing it in a usable measurement variable. It is usually too idiosyncratic and heterogeneous to “sum up” easily and introduce as an explanatory variable. However, in some housing markets, architectural design consists of a limited number of standardized “prototypes”, which can then be used as explanatory variables in hedonic estimations. Such is the case for Riga, Latvia, where almost the entire housing stock fits into about a score of fairly standardized architectural design types. This paper is an empirical analysis of the Riga housing market, which only became a “market” in a meaningful sense after the collapse of the Soviet regime in Latvia. The paper analyzes a set of about 3500 transactions, all from recent years. We estimate the elasticity of housing value with respect to size of housing units and some other physical features, and the value of the different architectural designs, controlling for location.

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel approach to the perceptual interpretation of building facades that combines shape grammars, supervised classification and random walks. Procedural modeling is used to model the geometric and the photometric variation of buildings. This is fused with visual classification techniques (randomized forests) that provide a crude probabilistic interpretation of the observation space in order to measure the appropriateness of a procedural generation with respect to the image. A random exploration of the grammar space is used to optimize the sequence of derivation rules towards a semantico-geometric interpretation of the observations. Experiments conducted on complex architecture facades with ground truth validate the approach.},

Movers' demand for housing is derived from a life-cycle problem with credit market frictions. Equilibrium house prices adjust to assign houses that differ by quality to movers who differ by age, income, and wealth. To quantify the model, we measure distributions of house prices, house qualities, and mover characteristics from micro-data on San Diego County during the 2000s boom. The main result is that cheaper credit for poor households was a major driver of prices, especially at the low end of the market.},

abstract = {<p>Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the cross-validation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as “knowledge engines” in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality—especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.</p>},

abstract = {Semantic memory refers to knowledge about people, objects, actions, relations, self, and culture acquired through experience. The neural systems that store and retrieve this information have been studied for many years, but a consensus regarding their identity has not been reached. Using strict inclusion criteria, we analyzed 120 functional neuroimaging studies focusing on semantic processing. Reliable areas of activation in these studies were identified using the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) technique. These activations formed a distinct, left-lateralized network comprised of 7 regions: posterior inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate gyrus. Secondary analyses showed specific subregions of this network associated with knowledge of actions, manipulable artifacts, abstract concepts, and concrete concepts. The cortical regions involved in semantic processing can be grouped into 3 broad categories: posterior multimodal and heteromodal association cortex, heteromodal prefrontal cortex, and medial limbic regions. The expansion of these regions in the human relative to the nonhuman primate brain may explain uniquely human capacities to use language productively, plan, solve problems, and create cultural and technological artifacts, all of which depend on the fluid and efficient retrieval and manipulation of semantic knowledge.},

The bias leads to discontinuous drops in sale prices at 10,000-mile odometer thresholds, along with smaller drops at 1,000-mile thresholds. These findings reveal that information-processing heuristics matter even in markets with large stakes and easily observed information. We model left-digit bias in an inattention framework and structurally estimate the inattention parameter.

Some implications are obtained for market supply behavior, which indicates that the presence of stochastic development controls may distort housing supply in unexpected ways.},

abstract = {For estimation of tree parameters at the single-tree level using light detection and ranging (LiDAR), detection and delineation of individual trees is an important starting point. This paper presents an approach for delineating individual trees and estimating tree heights using LiDAR in coniferous (Pinus koraiensis, Larix leptolepis) and deciduous (Quercus spp.) forests in South Korea. To detect tree tops, the extended maxima transformation of morphological image-analysis methods was applied to the digital canopy model (DCM). In order to monitor spurious local maxima in the DCM, which cause false tree tops, different h values in the extended maxima transformation were explored. For delineation of individual trees, watershed segmentation was applied to the distance-transformed image from the detected tree tops. The tree heights were extracted using the maximum value within the segmented crown boundary. Thereafter, individual tree data estimated by LiDAR were compared to the field measurement data under five categories (correct delineation, satisfied delineation, merged tree, split tree, and not found). In our study, P. koraiensis, L. leptolepis, and Quercus spp. had the best detection accuracies of 68.1% at h = 0.18, 86.7% at h = 0.12, and 67.4% at h = 0.02, respectively. The coefficients of determination for tree height estimation were 0.77, 0.80, and 0.74 for P. koraiensis, L. leptolepis, and Quercus spp., respectively.},

abstract = {Traditional tools to map the distribution of urban green space have been hindered by either high cost and labour inputs or poor spatial resolution given the complex spatial structure of urban landscapes. What's more, those tools do not observe the urban landscape from a perspective in which citizens experience a city. We test a novel application of computer vision to quantify urban tree cover at the street-level. We do so by utilizing the open-source image data of city streetscapes that is now abundant (Google Street View). We show that a multi-step computer vision algorithm segments and quantifies the percent of tree cover in streetscape images to a high degree of precision. By then modelling the relationship between neighbouring images along city street segments, we are able to extend this image representation and estimate the amount of perceived tree cover in city streetscapes to a relatively high level of accuracy for an entire city. Though not a replacement for high resolution remote sensing (e.g., aerial LiDAR) or intensive field surveys, the method provides a new multi-feature metric of urban tree cover that quantifies tree presence and distribution from the same viewpoint in which citizens experience and see the urban landscape.},

Several years ago, one of the large mail-order houses undertook an experiment to discover the significance of these customary prices. If they proved to be of no particular importance, substantial economies in accounting were in the offing. The merchandising executives suspected that the pricing tradition survived because of universal indulgence they believed that, if attacked, it would soon give up the ghost. For certain items, the change from the customary to the rounded price indicated that sales were halved for others, no appreciable effect was noticeable for still others, sales were disproportionately large. Throughout the trial the prices of the leading competitor had, of course, remained unchanged. Detailed records of sales in the preceding and present period by classes and by regions permitted the company to account, with a fair degree of certainty, for all variables influenced demand, other than the departure from customary prices.},

But when rents rise, there may be substantial value associated with the option to redevelop to higher intensity per unit land value. In the presence of option value, we first demonstrate that hedonic linear regressions should include an additive non- negative term for the value of the option. This term increases in the variance of the underlying stochastic process. If this term is omitted, then estimates of implicit market prices for desirable (undesirable) characteristics will be biased downward (upward). This prediction is supported by recent empirical stud- ies. We further suggest that future empirical work can employ the nonlinear functional form derived from our theory.},

abstract = {The repeat sales model is commonly used to construct reliable house price indices in absence of individual characteristics of the real estate. Several adaptations of the original model by Bailey et al. (J Am Stat Assoc 58:933–942, 1963) are proposed in literature. They all have in common using a dummy variable approach for measuring price indices. In order to reduce the impact of transaction price noise on the estimates of price indices, Goetzmann (J Real Estate Finance Econ 5:5–53, 1992) used a random walk with drift process for the log price levels instead of the dummy variable approach. The model that is proposed in this article can be interpreted as a generalization of the Goetzmann methodology. We replace the random walk with drift model by a structural time series model, in particular by a local linear trend model in which both the level and the drift parameter can vary over time. An additional variable—the reciprocal of the time between sales—is included in the repeat sales model to deal with the effect of the time between sales on the estimated returns. This approach is robust can be applied in thin markets where relatively few selling prices are available. Contrary to the dummy variable approach, the structural time series model enables prediction of the price level based on preceding and subsequent information, implying that even for particular time periods where no observations are available an estimate of the price level can be provided. Conditional on the variance parameters, an estimate of the price level can be obtained by applying regression in the general linear model with a prior for the price level, generated by the local linear trend model. The variance parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood. The model is applied to several subsets of selling prices in the Netherlands. Results are compared to standard repeat sales models, including the Goetzmann model.},

abstract = {Which neighborhoods experience physical improvements? In this paper, we introduce a computer vision method to measure changes in the physical appearances of neighborhoods from time-series street-level imagery. We connect changes in the physical appearance of five US cities with economic and demographic data and find three factors that predict neighborhood improvement. First, neighborhoods that are densely populated by college-educated adults are more likely to experience physical improvements—an observation that is compatible with the economic literature linking human capital and local success. Second, neighborhoods with better initial appearances experience, on average, larger positive improvements—an observation that is consistent with “tipping” theories of urban change. Third, neighborhood improvement correlates positively with physical proximity to the central business district and to other physically attractive neighborhoods—an observation that is consistent with the “invasion” theories of urban sociology. Together, our results provide support for three classical theories of urban change and illustrate the value of using computer vision methods and street-level imagery to understand the physical dynamics of cities.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a simple model with anchoring and loss aversion to explain house price dynamics. The model has two testable implications: 1) when both cognitive biases are present, price dispersion and trade volume are pro-cyclical; 2) if anchoring decreases with time, then price dispersion and trade volume are higher for transactions with a previous purchase that is more recent. Using a data set that contains most real estate transactions in Hong Kong from 1992 to 2006, we find anchoring and loss aversion to be important, and the results are robust to type of housing and sample period. The finding is consistent with the strong correlations among house price, price dispersion, and volume found in the data. Moreover, anchoring, price dispersion and volume decrease with time since previous transaction. Our results suggest that anchoring and loss aversion contribute to the cyclicality of the housing market. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Over the past 30 years, eastern Massachusetts has seen a remarkable combination of rising home prices and declining supply of new homes, which doesn't appear to reflect any lack of land. In this paper, we examine the increasing number of land-use regulations in Greater Boston. These regulations vary widely over space, and are hard to predict with any variables other than historical density levels. Minimum lot size and other land use controls are associated with reductions in new construction activity. These regulations are associated with higher prices when we do not control for contemporary density and demographics, but not when we add these contemporaneous controls. These results are compatible with economic theory, which predicts that production restraints on a good won't increase the price of that good relative to sufficiently close substitutes. Current density levels appear to be too low to maximize local land values. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examine whether, and how, listing strategies impact sale prices in residential home sales. Literatures in housing economics, negotiations, and auctions offer diverse predictions around this question. On the one hand, housing studies typically treat home prices as an objective function of property and neighborhood characteristics. Yet, the large and robust literature on anchoring effects (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) suggests a positive relationship between listing prices and sale prices. Finally, evidence from the auctions literature suggests the opposite pattern through herding behaviors. We analyzed more than 14,000 transactions, taking into account observable property heterogeneity, geographical location and timing of the sales. We find that higher starting prices are indeed associated with higher selling prices, consistent with anchoring. For the average home in our sample, over-pricing between 10 and 20% leads to an increase in the sale price of $117-$163. This effect is particularly strong in areas with higher rates of mortgage foreclosure or serious delinquency. Additional analyses show that our results are unlikely to be driven by seller motivations or unobserved home qualities. We contrast our findings with recommendations and private beliefs of real estate agents, who provide services and advice for about 90% of home sales in the US. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Cliff and Ord (1969) devised a parsimonious specification for the structure of spatial dependence among observations that could be used to empirically model spatial interdependence. Later work (Cliff and Ord, 1973, 1981; Ord, 1975) further developed these ideas into basic spatial regression models, which were popularized and augmented by Anselin (1988). We discuss several issues that have arisen in recent work that attempts to extend basic models of spatial interdependence to include more types of spatial and non-spatial interdependencies. Understanding these issues should help future work avoid several pitfalls that plague current and past attempts at extensions along these lines. {\textcopyright} Southern Regional Science Association 2012.},

We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe four large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterizing the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.},

abstract = {Visual question answering requires high-order reasoning about an image, which is a fundamental capability needed by machine systems to follow complex directives. Recently, modular networks have been shown to be an effective framework for performing visual reasoning tasks. While modular networks were initially designed with a degree of model transparency, their performance on complex visual reasoning benchmarks was lacking. Current state-of-the-art approaches do not provide an effective mechanism for understanding the reasoning process. In this paper, we close the performance gap between interpretable models and state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods. We propose a set of visual-reasoning primitives which, when composed, manifest as a model capable of performing complex reasoning tasks in an explicitly-interpretable manner. The fidelity and interpretability of the primitives' outputs enable an unparalleled ability to diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of the resulting model. Critically, we show that these primitives are highly performant, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.1% on the CLEVR dataset. We also show that our model is able to effectively learn generalized representations when provided a small amount of data containing novel object attributes. Using the CoGenT generalization task, we show more than a 20 percentage point improvement over the current state of the art.},

Using a pre-sale as a mechanism of updating a developer's beliefs, this paper analyzes the impact of over- confidence on overbuilding and cycles in real estate markets. Our finding indicates that a pre-sale activity will increase the magnitude of over-building and over-confidence will increase the volatility in real estate markets.

abstract = {Section 1.1 of this chapter introduces the concept of spatial dependence that often arises in cross-sectional spatial data samples. Spatial data samples rep­ resent observations that are associated with points or regions, for example homes, counties, states, or census tracts. Two motivational examples are pro­ vided for spatial dependence, one based on spatial spillovers stemming from congestion effects and a second that relies on omitted explanatory variables. Section 1.2 sets forth spatial autoregressive data generating processes for spa­ tially dependent sample data along with spatial weight matrices that play an important role in describing the structure of these processes. We provide more detailed discussion of spatial data generating processes and associated spatial econometric models in Chapter 2, and spatial weight matrices in Chapter 4. Our goal here is to provide an introduction to spatial autoregressive processes and spatial regression models that rely on this type of process. Section 1.3 provides a simple example of how congestion effects lead to spatial spillovers that impact neighboring regions using travel times to the central business district (CBD) region of a metropolitan area. Section 1.4 describes various scenarios in which spatial econometric models can be used to analyze spatial spillover effects. The final section of the chapter lays out the plan of this text. A brief enumeration of the topics covered in each chapter is provided},

@article{Buckley2008,
abstract = {Ghana has been one of the most rapidly growing economies in sub-Saharan Africa. This growth has been aided by Ghana's improving policy environment. In light of this, the paper addresses the question of why, given its higher level of per capita income and relatively strong growth, the housing conditions of the poor in Accra are considerably worse than those in a number of other African cities with lower incomes. There are not many data available to answer this question, so the method is indirect and takes two approaches. First, a variant of the monocentric city model is used to calculate Accra's housing supply elasticity relative to those of other similarly sized African cities. The model suggests that housing supply responsiveness is considerably lower in Accra, a result consistent with the observed higher housing costs. Secondly, a number of traditional housing demand and reduced-form equations are estimated for Accra and the other cities. This allows the formation of a quantitative judgment about Accra's housing supply elasticity. Taken together, the two approaches indicate that lower-income families in Accra have such poor housing conditions because the market is extremely unresponsive to demand. The welfare costs of current housing and land policies are considerable. The results suggest that making Accra's real estate market more responsive would go a long way towards improving the effectiveness of the broader policy environment. It would also no doubt improve the housing conditions of the poor and help to reduce the city's expanding footprint.},

@article{Campbell2009,
abstract = {We apply the dynamic Gordon growth model to the housing market in 23 US metropolitan areas, the four Census regions, and the nation from 1975 to 2007. The model allows the rent-price ratio at each date to be split into the expected present discounted values of rent growth, real interest rates, and a housing premium over real rates. We show that housing premia are variable and forecastable and account for a significant fraction of rent-price ratio volatility at the national and local levels, and that covariances among the three components damp fluctuations in rent-price ratios. Thus, explanations of house-price dynamics that focus only on interest rate movements and ignore these covariances can be misleading. These results are similar to those found for stocks and bonds. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Automatically learned quality assessment for images has recently become a hot topic due to its usefulness in a wide variety of applications such as evaluating image capture pipelines, storage techniques and sharing media. Despite the subjective nature of this problem, most existing methods only predict the mean opinion score provided by datasets such as AVA [1] and TID2013 [2]. Our approach differs from others in that we predict the distribution of human opinion scores using a convolutional neural network. Our architecture also has the advantage of being significantly simpler than other methods with comparable performance. Our proposed approach relies on the success (and retraining) of proven, state-of-the-art deep object recognition networks. Our resulting network can be used to not only score images reliably and with high correlation to human perception, but also to assist with adaptation and optimization of photo editing/enhancement algorithms in a photographic pipeline. All this is done without need of a "golden" reference image, consequently allowing for single-image, semantic- and perceptually-aware, no-reference quality assessment.},

@article{Geltner2003,
abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on price determination in the private and public real estate markets. In particular, it discusses the processes of appraisal smoothing in the private market and of price discovery between the public and the private markets. In real estate markets, the absence of good quality information on price, whether because of lack of trades or confidentiality, has led to the widespread use of appraisals for market tracking and as the basis for performance measurement. Appraisers have to make an optimum assessment of value, based on fundamental variables and market information, including transactions and a market-wide appraisal index. However, transaction prices are a noisy signal and it is the appraiser's role to extract the signal from the noise in an efficient manner. This involves a process of optimal combination of past and current information and leads to appraisal smoothing. Price discovery is the process by which the opinions of market participants about the value of an asset are combined together into a single statistic--its market price. A development of this basic concept is where two markets have a common component of value and the relevant price information is discovered first in one market and then transmitted to the second market. The process of price discovery is considered between the public and private real estate markets. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This puzzling phenomenon survives a variety of controls for vintage effects, systematic risk heterogeneity, and sample selection biases. To explain these findings, I derive an equilibrium search-based illiquid asset-pricing model which, when calibrated, provides an excellent fit to the data. Thus a structural model of transaction risk seems crucial to understanding real estate investment returns. Recent empirical literature suggests that these insights can be extended to other illiquid asset classes such as private equity and residential real estate. },

Many studies document gender differences in decision making, and often attribute these differences to innate and stable factors, such as biological and hormonal differences. In three studies, we found that stereotype threat affected decision making and led to gender differences in loss-aversion and risk-aversion behaviors. In Study 1, women subjected to stereotype threat in academic and business settings were more loss averse than both men and women who were not facing the threat of being viewed in light of negative stereotypes. We found no gender differences in loss-aversion behavior in the absence of stereotype threat. In Studies 2a and 2b, we found the same pattern of effects for risk-aversion behavior that we had observed for loss-aversion behavior. In addition, in Study 2b, ego depletion mediated the effects of stereotype threat on women's decision making. These results suggest that individuals' decision making can be influenced by stereotype concerns.},

We then successfully proxy for a number of economic and demographic variables in US cities and states. We further obtain document-frequency measures of corruption by country and US state and replicate the econometric results of previous research studying its covariates. Finally, we provide the first measure of corruption in American cities.

Our analysis covers the period January 1990 through July 2005. Using data from the Global Property Research GPR 250 Property Securities Index, which has monthly prices for five property type indexes in 21 countries, we decompose country and property type sources of variation in real estate security returns. We find that property type effects are smaller than country effects. Property type specialization explains only 6% of the variance of national real estate securities index returns. Because property type effects are so small, country diversification is a more effective tool for achieving risk reduction than property type diversification. In addition, we find evidence that the relative importance of country effects is decreasing while that of industry effects is increasing. However, country effects continue to dominate property type effects.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {\nIf household portfolios are constrained by borrowing and short-sales restrictions, or by fixed costs of participating in risky asset markets, then alternative retirement savings systems may affect household welfare by relaxing these constraints. This paper uses a calibrated partial-equilibrium model of optimal life-cycle portfolio choice to explore the empirical relevance of these issues. In a benchmark case, we find ex-ante welfare gains equivalent to a 3.7% increase in consumption from the investment of half of retirement wealth in the equity market. The main channel through which these gains are realized is that the higher average return on equities permits a lower Social Security tax rate on younger households, which helps households smooth their consumption over the life cycle. There is a smaller welfare gain of 0.5% of consumption when Social Security tax rates are held constant. We also find that realistic heterogeneity of risk aversion and labor income risk can strongly affect optimal portfolio choice over the life cycle, which provides one argument for a privatized Social Security system with an element of personal portfolio choice. \n},

In this paper, we present a model where people make contacts and choose a mode of interaction: meeting face-to-face or communicating electronically. Cities are a means of reducing the fixed travel costs involved in face-to-face interactions. When telecommunications technology improves, there will be two opposing effects on cities and face-to-face interactions. First, some relationships that would have been face-to-face will be conducted electronically. Second, the increase in frequency of contact between individuals caused by improvements in telecommunications technology may result in more face-to-face interactions. If the second effect dominates, telecommunications improvements will complement both face-to-face interactions and cities. Our empirical work suggests that telecommunications may be a complement to, or at least not a strong substitute for, cities and face-to-face interactions.},

We document a well-functioning market that responded swiftly and predictably to exogenous shocks. We then explore the impact of adding rent to early modern price indices and estimates of living standards. Price indices show a moderate effect. The addition of rent reduces the gap between Toledo and two northern European locations by up to 9.5%.},

abstract = {The recent progress of spatial econometrics has developed a new technique called the "spatial hedonic approach," which considers the elements of spatial autocorrelation among property values and geographically distributed attributes. The practical difficulties in applying spatial econometric models include the specification of the spatial weight matrix (SWM), which affects the final analysis results. Some simulation studies suggest that information criteria such as AIC are useful for the SWM's selection, but if many model candidates exist (e.g., when the selections of explanatory variables are performed simultaneously), then the computational burden of calculating such criteria for each model is large. The present study develops an automatic model selection algorithm using the technique of reversible jump MCMC combined with simulated annealing; termed trans-dimensional simulated annealing (TDSA). The performance of the TDSA algorithm is verified using the well-known Boston housing dataset, and it is applied empirically to a Japanese real estate dataset. The obtained results suggest a two-step strategy for model selection, with SWM (W) first, followed by the explanatory variables (X and WX), will result in local optima, and therefore these variables should be selected simultaneously. The TDSA algorithm can find the significant variables that are "hidden" because of multicollinearity in the unrestricted model, and can attain the minimum AIC automatically. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Drawing on the organizational theory literature, and in-depth fieldwork with 50 high-technology ventures, we examine the effects of direct and indirect ties between entrepreneurs and 202 seed-stage investors on venture finance decisions.

The empirical analysis is conducted using a semilog hedonic house price equation and a spherical autocorrelation function with data for over 5000 transactions of homes sold between 1991:4 and 1993:1. Properties are geocoded and assigned to separate housing submarkets within metropolitan Dallas. Hedonic and spherical autocorrelation parameters are estimated separately for each submarket using estimated generalized least squares (EGLS). We {\textregistered}nd strong evidence of spatial autocorrelation in transaction prices within submarkets. Results for spatially autocorrelated residuals are mixed. In four of eight submarkets, there is evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the hedonic residuals for single-family properties located within a 1200 meter radius. In two submarkets, the hedonic residuals are spatially autocorrelated throughout the submarket, while the hedonic residuals are spatially uncorrelated in the remaining two submarkets. Finally, we compare OLS and kriged EGLS predicted values for properties sold during 1993:1. Kriged EGLS predictions are more accurate than OLS in six of eight submarkets, while OLS has smaller prediction errors in submarkets where the residuals are spatially uncorrelated and the estimated semivariogram has a large variance.},

abstract = {Until recently, few people in mainland China would dispute the significance of the hukou (household registration) system in affecting their lives – indeed, in determining their fates. At the macro level, the centrality of this system has led some to argue that the industrialization strategy and the hukou system were the crucial organic parts of the Maoist model: the strategy could not have been implemented without the system. A number of China scholars in the West, notably Christiansen, Chan, Cheng and Seiden, Solinger, and Mallee, have begun in recent years to study this important subject in relation to population mobility and its social and economic ramifications. Unlike population registration systems in many other countries, the Chinese system was designed not merely to provide population statistics and identify personal status, but also directly to regulate population distribution and serve many other important objectives desired by the state. In fact, the hukou system is one of the major tools of social control employed by the state. Its functions go far beyond simply controlling population mobility.},

abstract = {When land regulations are binding, then the land price per m2 is determined by the attractiveness of the location and the restrictiveness of the regulation. In the case of a maximum floor area ratio (FARmax) restriction, the best use land price can be directly expressed as a function of the FARmax and local amenities. We show theoretically and empirically how this approach can be used to determine land values from residential rents. From our empirical results, we derive two main sources for a monocentric structure of land prices. First, the location attractiveness of centrally located dwellings makes land prices more expensive. Second, on a regulatory basis, the FARmax works as a multiplier for land prices. Because the FARmax is high in central areas, land prices are inflated accordingly. Our model gives insight into determinants of urban land prices. In addition, it is a useful approach for land appraisal in urban regions.},

The recent recession had several defining characteristics: it took place simultaneously with a global recession; the financial sector was both the source and propagator of the crisis; the exchange rate depreciated sharply; and there was a substantial loosening of monetary policy alongside a marked increase in the fiscal deficit. But despite UK output falling by more than 6% between 2008 Q1 and 2009 Q3, CPI inflation remains above the Government's 2% inflation target. To mark the 50th anniversary of the Quarterly Bulletin, this article places these recent events in a long-run historical context. It looks at an extensive range of macroeconomic and financial data reaching back as far as the early 18th century. uses these data to draw out some of the key features of historical recessions and recoveries, drawing on the extensive literature on the United Kingdom's economic history.(2) This collection of data is provided as an annex to this article.(3) Although the UK economy has undergone structural change over this period, the past may contain lessons for the current recovery.},

However, we argue that the impact of the supply of new land by the Hong Kong government is not as important as they maintain in accounting for the volatile house prices in Hong Kong, We show that there is no causal relationship between land supply and housing prices. Our estimations, based on the annual data of Hong Kong's public land sales, find that the government acts to maximise land revenue. Maximisation of revenue from land sales is, however, consistent with the efficient allocation of resources. We also show that the amount of land sales by the government and land in developers' land banks tend to decrease when market interest rates increase. Land banking behaviour is governed by economic conditions. Long-term land holding costs should cover interest costs.},

abstract = {To feed its 1.3??billion population with a per capita cultivated land far below the world average, China is already facing a great challenge of land scarcity. Accelerated urbanization along with explosive economic growth has further worsened the shortage of agricultural land over the last two decades. Increasing concern over land is expressed in terms of soil availability for grain production and soil quality degradation. Based on official statistics and data derived from satellite imagery, dynamics of China's cultivated land over the past two decades is outlined and the causes and destinations of cultivated land loss are analyzed in this paper. Particularly, urbanization-related land-use changes and their spatial variation across the country are demonstrated. Furthermore, impacts of urbanization and associated waste disposals, consequent shifts of soil utilization on areal soil quality are expatiated. It is initially concluded that China's cultivated land is shrinking at a rather shocking rate. Although conversion to urban and industrial uses took up a comparatively small share of total cultivated land loss, urbanization should still be considered as a great threat to future agricultural production for several reasons. Urbanization is increasing the risk of soil pollution through waste disposal and acid deposition derived from urban air pollution. Facing rapid urbanization, China is making positive policy responses to the challenge of decreasing availability of cultivated land and offering unremitting efforts towards the goal of national food security. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We examine two questions: Does the roundness or precision of prices bias magnitude judgments? If so, do these biased judgments affect buyer behavior? Results from five studies suggest that buyers underestimate the magnitudes of precise prices. We term this the precision effect. The first three studies are laboratory experiments designed to test the existence of the precision effect and examine the underlying psychological processes. In Study 1, we find that precise prices are judged to be smaller than round prices of similar magnitudes. For example, participants in this experiment incorrectly judged $395,425 to be smaller than $395,000. In Study 2, we show that precision is more likely to affect magnitude judgments under conditions of uncertainty. Study 3 demonstrates that manipulating prior experience with the pattern of roundness and precision in numbers can moderate the precision effect. Studies 4 and 5 examine whether the precision effect influences buyers' willingness to pay for negotiated purchases (e.g., houses). In Study 4, we conduct an experiment on a nationally representative sample of homeowners to demonstrate that participants are willing to pay more for houses when the sellers use precise (e.g., $364,578) instead of comparable round (e.g., $365,000) prices. In Study 5, we analyze data from residential real estate transactions in two separate markets and find that buyers pay higher sale prices when list prices are more precise. These empirical results enrich our understanding of the psychological processes that underlie price magnitude judgments and have substantive implications for buyer and seller behavior.},

abstract = {In recent years, China has instituted a variety of reforms to its hukou system, an institution with the power to restrict population mobility and access to state-sponsored benefits for the majority of China's rural population. A wave of newspaper stories published in late 2005 understood the latest round of reform initiatives to suggest that the hukou is set to be abolished, and that rural residents will soon be ‘‘granted urban rights.'' This article clarifies the basic operations of the hukou system in light of recent reforms to examine the validity of these claims. We point out that confusion over the functional operations of the hukou system and the nuances of the hukou lexicon have contributed to the overstated interpretation of the initiative. The cumulative effect of these reforms is not abolition of the hukou, but devolution of responsibility for hukou policies to local governments, which in many cases actually makes permanent migration of peasants to cities harder than before. At the broader level, the hukou system, as a major divide between the rural and urban population, remains potent and intact.},

To this end, we propose a two-stage approach that firstly learns characteristic visual patterns for different building epochs at patch-level and then globally aggregates patch-level age estimates over the building. We compile evaluation datasets from different sources and perform an detailed evaluation of our approach, its sensitivity to parameters, and the capabilities of the employed deep networks to learn characteristic visual age-related patterns. Results show that our approach is able to estimate building age at a surprisingly high level that even outperforms human evaluators and thereby sets a new performance baseline. This work represents a first step towards the automated assessment of building parameters for automated price prediction.},

Some organizations have therefore produced AI ethics checklists, as well as checklists for more specific concepts , such as fairness, as applied to AI systems. But unless checklists are grounded in practitioners' needs, they may be misused. To understand the role of checklists in AI ethics, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 48 practitioners, focusing on fairness. We co-designed an AI fairness checklist and identified desiderata and concerns for AI fairness checklists in general. We found that AI fairness checklists could provide organizational infrastructure for formalizing ad-hoc processes and empowering individual advocates. We discuss aspects of organizational culture that may impact the efficacy of such checklists, and highlight future research directions.},

The study area covers the Thames Gateway and Thames Valley, which lie to the east and west of London respectively. However, whereas the latter is one of the wealthiest areas of England, the former includes some of the highest pockets of deprivation and was a government priority area for increasing housing supply. Due to differences in historical land use and geography, the price elasticity in the least constrained area is approximately six times higher than the most constrained.},

abstract = {A project to map national land use/cover in China was initialized in the latter half of the 1990s. A national land use/cover database of China (NLUD-C, hereafter) at 1:100000 scale that contains Chinese land use/cover data of five periods (1980s, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2008) was developed during the project. To elucidate long-period sequence land use/cover data for land use/cover change driving factor analysis and ecological environment change research, this database was updated in 2010. Because the NLUD-C focuses more on the thematic and location precisions of land use/cover change dynamics, remote sensing images with approximately 30m spatial resolution, visual interpretation, field survey and large amounts of auxiliary information were applied during the update process. The results reveal that the change of land use/cover is more complex with 35 change forms among the first-level types and 480 change forms among second-level types between 2008 and 2010. The amount of land use/cover change patches reaches 108,006, and the dynamic area is 40,083.68km2. In addition, the NLUD-C accuracy for the selected polygons is more than 96.67%, and the accuracy of the selected first-level types is more than 95.41%. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

This paper considers various measures of housing supply in the Netherlands, where real house prices have roughly tripled since 1970. Besides the volume of investment in residential structures, and new housing construction in units, we derive time series of structure and location quality in a hedonic analysis. Each of these variables appears to be almost fully inelastic with respect to house prices in at least the short to medium long run. Further analysis of the quality of location index shows that conventional models of competitive land and housing markets cannot account for these findings. However, they may be well explained in terms of the rather extensive body of interventions by the Dutch government.},

Neighbourhood context can be used to supplement spectral information, and a novel way of incorporating spatial dependence in a hetero- geneous region is tested here using an ensemble learning technique called random forests and a measure of local spatial dependence called the Getis statistic. The overall Kappa accuracy of the random forest classifier that used a combination of spectral and local spatial (Getis) variables at three different neighbourhood sizes (3x3, 7x7, and 11x11) ranged from 0.85 to 0.92. This accuracy was higher than that of a non-spatial random forest classifier having an overall Kappa accuracy of 0.78, which was run using the spectral variables only. This study demonstrated that the use of the Getis statistic with different neighbourhood sizes leads to substantial increase in per class classification accuracy of heterogeneous land-cover categories.},

abstract = {We investigate whether prospect theory preferences can predict a disposition effect. We consider two implementations of prospect theory: in one case, preferences are defined over annual gains and losses; in the other, they are defined over realized gains and losses. Surprisingly, the annual gain/loss model often fails to predict a disposition effect. The realized gain/loss model, however, predicts a disposition effect more reliably. Utility from realized gains and losses may therefore be a useful way of thinking about certain aspects of individual investor trading. ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST FACTS ABOUT THE TRADING of individual investors is the " disposition effect " : when an individual investor sells a stock in his portfolio, he has a greater propensity to sell a stock that has gone up in value since pur-chase than one that has gone down. The effect has been documented in all the available large databases of individual investor trading activity and has been linked to important pricing phenomena such as post-earnings announcement drift and stock-level momentum. Disposition effects have also been uncovered in other settings—in the real estate market, for example, and in the exercise of executive stock options.},

@article{Hoesli2015,
abstract = {\nIn this article, the authors use sector-level unlevered real estate investment trust (REIT) and direct real estate data to study whether the "escrow lag" in the recording of private market prices could explain the observed lead lag relationship between REITs and direct real estate markets. They find evidence of REIT returns leading private returns in the office and retail sectors even after catering for a 90-day escrow lag. These lead lag relationships are due to the slow reaction of private market returns to shocks in REIT returns, the risk premium, and consumer sentiment. In contrast, the authors do not observe such a lead lag relationship in the apartment and industrial sectors. The findings have implications regarding portfolio allocation, return predictability, and recommended shifts in the allocation between private and public real estate during crisis periods. \n},

abstract = {In this paper, we use a unique data set on granted mortgages to investigate whether immigrant and native borrowers are treated differently by lenders in the Spanish mortgage market. We observe that immigrant borrowers are charged substantially higher interest rates in their mortgages than their native counterparts. These differentials remain high and significant even after controlling for differences in creditworthiness and other factors. Further analyses based on the decomposition of the native-immigrant interest rate gap reveal that the differences in observable factors only account for 12% of the gap. The empirical evidence we find here suggests that these differentials are due to discrimination. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},
